# Study Buddy: A Project by Sloane Stein

## Project Overview
Study Buddy is an educational application developed during my 8-week internship with Billion Dollar Startup Ideas (March 2025). The app addresses a gap in the educational technology market by providing a learning experience tailored to different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).

## The Problem
Through extensive market research and competitive analysis, we identified that while there are many study tools available, none effectively combine comprehensive features with personalized learning style adaptation.

## Development Journey
My internship followed a structured product development methodology:

1. **Market Analysis & Problem Definition** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Explored various app and business ideas
   - Studied fundamental business principles: target market identification, problem-solution fit
   - Identified education technology as an underserved market segment

2. **Competitive Analysis** (Weeks 3-4)
   - Conducted thorough analysis of existing solutions (Quizlet, ZenAnki, Khan Academy)
   - Identified key feature gaps and opportunities for differentiation
   - Established unique value proposition for Study Buddy

3. **Product Design & Wireframing** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Created comprehensive wireframes for the application
   - Designed user flow for document uploading and solution generation
   - Focused on intuitive UX for different learning modalities

4. **Development & AI Integration** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Implemented core features using React
   - Integrated AI capabilities for enhanced study experience
   - Optimized for performance and user experience

## Wireframes and UI Design

During the design phase, we created detailed wireframes to visualize the user experience and interface of Study Buddy. These wireframes helped us understand how users would interact with various features and ensure the design supported different learning styles.

### Main Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a clean, intuitive interface with:
- Navigation menu for quick access to key areas (Dashboard, Courses, Study Groups, Profile)
- Sidebar with categorized subjects and study tools
- Progress tracking cards displaying daily study metrics
- Upcoming tasks and deadlines
- Quick resume option for ongoing learning sessions

### Learning Styles Profile

A key differentiator for Study Buddy is the personalized learning profile that:
- Analyzes and displays the user's primary learning style (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Social)
- Provides customized study recommendations based on learning preferences
- Displays optimal study patterns and timing
- Suggests methods to develop weaker learning areas

### Interactive Learning Games

Educational games designed to reinforce learning concepts with:
- Level-based progression to match skill development
- Real-time scoring and feedback
- Power-ups and hints to assist with challenging problems
- Visual progress tracking
- Time-based challenges to improve recall speed
