# Study Buddy

## Project Overview
Study Buddy is an educational application developed during my 8-week internship with Billion Dollar Startup Ideas (March 2025). The app addresses a gap in the educational technology market by providing a learning experience tailored to different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).

## The Problem
Through extensive market research and competitive analysis, we identified that while there are many study tools available, none effectively combine comprehensive features with personalized learning style adaptation.

## Development Journey
My internship followed a structured product development methodology:

1. **Market Analysis & Problem Definition** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Explored various app and business ideas
   - Studied fundamental business principles: target market identification, problem-solution fit
   - Identified education technology as an underserved market segment

2. **Competitive Analysis** (Weeks 3-4)
   - Conducted thorough analysis of existing solutions (Quizlet, ZenAnki, Khan Academy)
   - Identified key feature gaps and opportunities for differentiation
   - Established unique value proposition for Study Buddy

3. **Product Design & Wireframing** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Created comprehensive wireframes for the application
   - Designed user flow for document uploading and solution generation
   - Focused on intuitive UX for different learning modalities

4. **Development & AI Integration** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Implemented core features using React
   - Integrated AI capabilities for enhanced study experience
   - Optimized for performance and user experience
